    # The @property decorator in Python converts a method into a read-only attribute, allowing access like a variable instead of a method call. It is commonly used for encapsulation to control attribute access.
    
# Python (self): Explicitly passes the instance as the first argument (self) in instance methods.
# Java/C++ (this): Implicitly refers to the current instance inside the class, without needing to pass it as an argument.
# A staticmethod in Python is a method that belongs to a class but doesnâ€™t access or modify instance (self) or class (cls) attributes.    Can be called using the class name without creating an object.    Useful for utility/helper functions related to the class.
